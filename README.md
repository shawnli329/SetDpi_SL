# About SetDPI_SL

If you need to change the scale of the monitor frequently, this may be the best way. You only need to click the mouse twice. In the traditional way, you need to click the start menu of Windows, select Settings, click System, click Screen, click the monitor you want to set, and then click the drop-down of Zoom.

I did some changes, make it a mouse click programe, by click the tray icon in task bar, you can change the windows scale of your monitor. It can work on single and multi-monitor setup.

## How to use

Download the release version, click to run, then right click the icon in the task bar, choose the monitor and the scales you want to change.
